      "['Lauding the Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said only the BJP respected the middle class of the country and the Budget was focused on ensuring that “Modi’s Guarantees” were fulfilled .\\n\\nAddressing his final rally in the capital at R.K. Puram ahead of the Delhi Assembly election in support of BJP candidates on Sunday, he said, “For building Viksit Bharat , I gave a ‘guarantee’ to strengthen the country’s four pillars. These pillars are the youth, poor, farmers and women. The Budget presented yesterday [Saturday] ensures that the guarantees of Modi are fulfilled. Over the past years, we delivered free ration, free health treatment and pucca houses to the poor,” Mr. Modi said, adding that Ms. Sitharaman had presented a “Budget for the people”.\\n\\nThe BJP government was investing money on building roads, schools, hospitals, and infrastructure, he added.\\n\\nTaking on the Aam Aadmi Party, Mr. Modi asked voters to remove the party from government and bring in an era of development, as other States had seen under BJP governments. “Will you remove AAPda?[disaster]”, he asked the crowd, and said, “AAPda of Delhi wasted 11 years, so my request is to give us a chance to serve you once. I guarantee that I will spend all my efforts to remove every problem and difficulty.”\\n\\nA “double-engine government” must be formed in Delhi to channelise energy into beautifying and decorating Delhi, instead of “fighting and making excuses”. Even by mistake, the AAP government should not return to power, which would lead to five more wasted years, he warned.\\n\\nStepping up the attack on AAP, the PM stated that “the AAP’s jhaadu [broom, the AAP’s party symbol] was being scattered everywhere”. “The AAP leaders are leaving the party as they can see the anger against the AAP on ground,” he said, speaking about the eight AAP MLAs joining the BJP days ahead of the election. The MLAs had not received a ticket from the AAP for the election.\\n\\nTaking on the Congress, Mr. Modi said under the Congress governments, the middle class would lose their sleep for nights, before and after the Budget, but the BJP had presented a Budget that provided relief to the middle class. He said: “Let me paint a picture for you. Under the Nehru government, if you were earning ₹12 lakh,  approximately one-fourth of your salary would have gone to the government. Under the Indira Gandhi government, you would have had to part with over ₹2 lakh in taxes. But now, under the BJP government, someone earning ₹12 lakh per annum will not have to give any money to the government. Congress governments only levied taxes to fill their own coffers. But BJP looks at relief for the people.”\\n\\nHe also reassured people that when the BJP came to power in Delhi, no schemes will be rolled back and no homes will be demolished, while dismissing the AAP’s allegations on the issue as lies.\\n\\nAssuring people that the BJP will work towards their benefit, he listed out promises made by the party and the measures in the Budget meant to benefit them. Appealing to the youth, sportpersons and traders, Mr. Modi said that the Budget will especially be beneficial for them.', 'The EVMs and VVPAT machines used in the Delhi Assembly election have been kept in 70 strongrooms and are secured by a three-tier cordon, Delhi Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) R. Alice Vaz said on Thursday.\\n\\n“These strongrooms, one for each Assembly constituency, are being safeguarded with stringent security measures as part of the Election Commission’s protocols,” read a statement by the CEO.\\n\\nIt added that paramilitary forces personnel are guarding the innermost perimeter of the strongrooms, while the State-armed police have been tasked with securing the outer perimeter.\\n\\n“24x7 CCTV surveillance is in place, covering all sealed doors and corridors, and a double-lock system ensures additional security,” the Delhi CEO said. It added, “The strongrooms are accessible only through a single entry/exit point to prevent unauthorised access.”\\n\\nOperational control rooms have been set up adjacent to the strongrooms and entry is prohibited for all vehicles, including those of VIPs and officials, the CEO also said.\\n\\nIn addition, Ms. Vaz stated that all election-related documents were found to be in order during the scrutiny, and added that the presence of observers, candidates and representatives ensured fairness in the electoral process.\\n\\nShe said that re-election would not be required on any of the 70 constituencies, as no complaints were received from any of the 699 candidates.', 'A day before polling for the 70-member Delhi Assembly , the Delhi police on Tuesday (February 4, 2025) registered an FIR against Chief Minister Atishi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate from Kalkaji Assembly seat, for violating the model code of conduct (MCC), an officer said.\\n\\nThe police also registered a case against Manish Bidhuri and Ravi Dayama, the family members of BJP candidate Ramesh Bidhuri who is up against the CM in the south-east Delhi constituency, for poll code violation. Two AAP members — Ashmit and Sagar Mehta — were booked for assaulting a police constable.\\n\\nParty chief Arvind Kejriwal lashed out at the Election Commission (EC) and the Delhi police for “targeting his party” and “allowing the BJP” to violate the poll code openly. Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann also raised questions over the “integrity of the EC and Delhi Police”.\\n\\nAccording to the police, Ms. Atishi, along with 60 to 70 supporters seated in 10 vehicles, arrived at Fateh Singh Marg in Govindpuri at 12.39 a.m. “They [AAP workers] were asked to vacate the area as the poll campaign had ended. But they refused to do so and obstructed head constable Kaushal Pal from discharging his duty,” a senior officer said, adding that the two AAP members also assaulted Mr. Pal.\\n\\nDeputy Commissioner of Police (South East) Ravi Kumar Singh said the family members of the BJP candidate were found roaming in Kalkaji despite not being registered voters of the area and were booked for violating the MCC.\\n\\nIn a post in Hindi on X, the AAP chief said that the police had acted against the CM “after she complained [to the police] about the open hooliganism of the BJP”.\\n\\nIn a post on the social networking platform, Ms. Atishi said, “Ramesh Bidhuri ji ’s family members are openly violating the MCC. No action is being taken against them. I filed a complaint and called the police, and they [the police] filed a case against me.”\\n\\nHitting back, the former BJP MP said Ms. Atishi “is in a panic over her imminent defeat” and asked her to “maintain the dignity befitting a CM”.', 'Sitting next to his stall on a packed afternoon in the Ghazipur wholesale vegetable market, Md. Suleman witnesses several potential customers bristling with anger when he quotes the prices of ginger and garlic, which are the two items he sells. “₹280 a kilo! Am I buying garlic or gold?” snaps Radha Devi. The 32-year-old complains about how little one can purchase with a ₹500 currency note and the apathy of political leaders about the travails of the middle class and asks the vendor to pack garlic worth ₹50.\\n\\nMr. Suleman says that food inflation, coupled with the shrinking purchasing power of his customers, has caused a big drop in his daily earnings. “The nature of this market is such that we have to keep reducing our margins and bring down the prices every hour to sell off the items by day end. These problems find no mention in any party manifesto,” adds the 48-year-old Delhi voter.\\n\\nSeveral vegetable sellers The Hindu spoke to across the Capital had similar experiences. Their earnings have decreased over the past two to three years even as little has been done to provide basic facilities, such as drinking water, at the mandi s.\\n\\nHearing Mr. Suleman, his neighbouring vendor Indra Pal pitches in.\\n\\n“Despite paying rent for our spots in the mandi , we still have to reach hours in advance to secure a place. Why can’t the parties in power build designated stalls for us? Why do we need to come here by 12 a.m. every night to be able to queue up for a slot and start selling at 3 a.m.,” asks the 55-year-old voter.\\n\\nAt the Okhla wholesale market, 44-year-old Md. Emraan, who sells fruits, says while inflation has impacted everyone, “People will still have to buy vegetables. It is the fruit seller who has taken the worst hit.”\\n\\nHe adds, “I used to sell at least 120 cartons of fruits daily till 2022. Now my shop barely does business of 30 cartons a day. But no leader talks about it. They are busy pitting people against each other.”\\n\\nDespite the fall in earnings, Mr. Emraan says the fixed costs the traders pay as rent for their shop have not reduced.\\n\\n“There are no clean sources of potable water at the market. So, every day we spend over ₹200 on buying drinking water,” he adds. Rajeev, another fruit seller, says, “Over the past three years, my daily profit has fallen sharply from ₹2,000 to ₹500.”', 'As she drives her e-rickshaw through the streets of south Delhi’s Khanpur, ignoring the stares of passersby, Savitri, 49, says she would like Delhi to be a more inclusive city for women. She adds that better roads and improved law and order will be on her mind when she goes out to vote on Wednesday (February 5).\\n\\nInflation, too, is a pressing concern for her. “Free bus rides help me because I travel from Khanpur to the auto stand in Nehru Place every day,” she says. However, the promises of monthly cash transfer schemes announced by the three major political parties of the Capital — AAP (₹2,100), BJP (₹2,500), and Congress (₹2,500) — don’t appeal to her as she is sceptical about their implementation.\\n\\nBut for Lajjawati, 38, a domestic help who lives in Kusumpur Pahari, a slum cluster close to the affluent Vasant Kunj, the promise of ₹2,000 a month is a key issue.\\n\\n“If I get around ₹2,000 in my account every month, I will be able to spend more on food for my children and manage the household better,” says the mother of four.\\n\\nHer faith in the ruling party’s ability, in the event of its victory, to keep providing subsidised water and electricity and free bus rides for women is countered by her neighbour, Renu Kohri, 50, who says that even after 10 years of AAP’s rule, they still have to climb over broken roads to fetch potable water.\\n\\nWith women comprising nearly 46% (over 71 lakh) of Delhi’s 1.55 crore voters, the major parties have kept them at the centre of their poll pitches.\\n\\nTo Ajmati Begum, 40, a homemaker from Kalkaji, ideology matters more than election sops. “I will vote against religious politics,” she adds.\\n\\nFor younger voters like Meenakshi Sharma, 28, a resident of Kamla Nagar, representation matters, along with education, health policies and women’s safety. “It is good to see a woman candidate as you feel represented and heard.', 'Kapil Mishra , the BJP candidate from north-east Delhi’s Karawal Nagar Assembly seat is leading with number of 45,534, after counting of 15 rounds. As the counting is underway for the Delhi Assembly election , the emerging trend shows he surpassed BJP’s Mustafabad Mohan Singh Bisht vote numbers.\\n\\nMohan Singh Bisht has been winning from Karawal Nagar seat with BJP’s ticket except for the year 2015 when he lost the constituency to Kapil Mishra who was a AAP member back then.\\n\\nScreengrab from EC website at the end of seventeenth round of counting.\\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \\n                                Election Commission\\n\\nAfter winning from Karawal Nagar in 2015, Mr. Mishra was subsequently inducted into the Cabinet as the Water Resources Minister but was sacked in 2017 for “anti-party activities”. He joined the BJP in 2019 and was appointed vice-president of its Delhi unit four years later.\\n\\nMr. Mishra, who is one of the party’s most visible Purvanchali faces in the Capital , was accused of making hate speeches in the run-up to the north-east Delhi communal riots in February 2020, which left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.\\n\\nIn February 2020, when an agitation against the\\xa0Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) quickly spiralled out of control Delhi’s north -east area was severly affectes and  Mustafabad and Karawal Nagar were among the riot affected localities.\\n\\nMohan Singh Bisht, a five-time MLA, is one of the heavyweight candidates of BJP.\\n\\nWithin hours of dropping his name from Karawal Nagar and Mr. Bisht announcing he would contest as an Independent, the BJP named him on January 12 as a candidate but from a different seat – Mustafabad.\\n\\nAfter his name was dropped, Mr. Bisht had issued a warning to his party saying, “You have challenged the samaj [Uttarakhand community], not Mohan Singh Bisht. The BJP will lose at least 8-10 seats because of this decision, including Karawal Nagar, Burari, Mustafabad and Gokalpuri.”\\n\\nHe said, “I have assured them [BJP] that I will contest from Mustafabad and win the seat for the party.” The BJP has fielded former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Kapil Mishra from Karawal Nagar earlier.\\n\\nMustafabad Assembly is the same constituency that saw the highest voter turnout in north-east Delhi as it recorded 69% footfalls , according to\\xa0Election Commission data.', 'The new Delhi government will have six cabinet ministers, including Parvesh Verma who defeated AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal in the recent Assembly polls, who will be administered the oath of office on Thursday (February 20, 2025) afternoon, officials said.\\n\\nA Union Home Ministry notification stated that the President, on the advice of Chief Minister designate Rekha Gupta , appointed BJP MLAs Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma, Ashish Sood, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Ravinder Indraj, Kapil Mishra and Pankaj Kumar Singh as ministers of the Delhi government.\\n\\nThe new Ministers will take oath along with CM-designate Ms. Gupta in a ceremony to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other dignitaries at Ramlila Maidan later in the day.', 'In the summer of 2011, Anna Hazare, a Maharashtra-based social activist, started a fast-unto-death protest in the national capital’s Ramlila Maidan, seeking a ‘Jan Lokpal Bill’ to fight corruption.\\n\\nThe movement ‘India Against Corruption’ was quick to catch the public imagination, pulling thousands into the sprawling grounds at the heart of Delhi, as it grabbed national and international headlines.\\n\\nMany thought it was India’s moment of revolution.\\n\\nThe then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was forced to engage with the ‘Team Anna’ to draft a Jan Lokpal Bill. But as their demands were not satisfactorily met, Arvind Kejriwal, one of the chief architects of the movement, and others left Mr. Hazare behind and formed a political party on November 26, 2012 — the Aam Aadmi Party (Common Man’s Party).\\n\\nThe party’s main aim was to fight corruption, and surprising many political observers, it came to power in Delhi in December 2013, with the outside support of the Congress. Mr. Kejriwal, an IIT graduate who had worked as an IRS officer, was sworn in as the Chief Minister.\\n\\nTasting success in Delhi, the party was ready to spread its wings beyond the capital, and ahead of fighting against the BJP’s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Mr. Kejriwal read out a list of corrupt political leaders, while addressing party members in Delhi in January 2014. The list included P. Chidambaram, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Kapil Sibal, Farooq Abdullah, Sharad Pawar and Rahul Gandhi. “This is just the beginning and the list will grow. Should they be defeated this time or not?” he asked the audience.\\n\\nFast forward 11 years. AAP leaders, including Mr. Kejriwal, now share stage with many of these leaders and is part of the opposition alliance ‘INDIA’, along with the Congress.\\n\\nOver the 12 years since its formation, the AAP seems to have slowly slid away from at least some of its founding ideas and in many ways become similar to another ‘aam party’ (common party) from ‘aam aadmi party’. From fighting corruption as its core idea to hardly talking about it now; from Mr. Kejriwal travelling in Delhi Metro and an old blue WagonR car to swanky SUVs now; from statements of Mr. Kejriwal not taking bungalows to a controversy of renovating his government bungalow for over ₹30 crore today– the list of changes and contradictions goes on, each one pushing the AAP a little more closer to any other political party.\\n\\nThe AAP has come a long way politically from the Ramlila Maidan. After coming to power in Delhi in December 2013, the AAP government resigned after 49 days as it was not able to table a ‘Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill’ in the Assembly, lacking necessary numbers. Mr. Kejriwal then went back to the people of Delhi and they gave the AAP a historic mandate of 67 out of 70 seats in 2015, and the AAP returned to power in 2020 by winning 62 seats. The party came to power in Punjab in 2022 and later that year, it won five seats in Gujarat with a 12.9% vote share. This performance led to the party getting the ‘national party’ status in 2023, in just a little over 10 years since its formation.\\n\\nBut along this journey, founding members such as Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav were expelled, while many others left the party. As the party grew, the power also consolidated in the hands of one man – Mr. Kejriwal — and his inner circle.\\n\\nIn January 2021, the party quietly amended its constitution, changing a clause that prevented anyone from holding a post for more than two consecutive terms of three years each. This made way for Mr. Kejriwal to continue as the national convener, the highest post in the party. The AAP has in many ways become synonymous with Mr. Kejriwal and the party’s manifesto is even called “Kejriwal’s Guarantees”.\\n\\nOver the years, the AAP’s electoral politics has crystallised into a promise of welfarism and subsidies, peppered with Hindu symbolism and nationalism. Mr. Kejriwal does not shy away from saying they are building ‘Ram Rajya’ in Delhi and even built a 30-feet-high replica of the ‘Ram Mandir’ in Delhi, using public funds as part of Diwali celebration of the Delhi government and did puja with his Cabinet colleagues at the replica.\\n\\nDuring the anti-CAA protests in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, Mr. Kejriwal tactfully stayed away. He even said he would have got the roads cleared of the protesters if his government had control of the Delhi Police.\\n\\nIn 2019, the AAP voted in favour of the abrogation of Article 370 and the Bill stripping Jammu and Kashmir of Statehood. In the run up to the 2025 Delhi Assembly election, Mr. Kejriwal did not campaign in many areas with sizeable Muslim population such as Mustafabad and Okhla.\\n\\nOne of the hardest blows the AAP received since its inception was in 2022, when allegations of a scam in the Delhi excise policy started to shake the AAP, leading to the arrest of senior leaders, including Mr. Kejriwal and his trusted deputy Manish Sisodia. The AAP supremo, who came out on bail in September last year, resigned as the Chief Minister, stating he wants to prove his innocence in ‘Janata Ki Adalat’ (people’s court) as the court case will drag on for years. Atishi, Mr. Kejriwal’s confidante, succeeded him as Chief Minister for the remaining term.\\n\\nBoth Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Sisodia lost the election along with the AAP when results were out on February 8.\\n\\nAs dust settles on the Delhi polls, the AAP is left with a question: what hurts more? The party losing power in Delhi or the party chief losing the election? For the AAP, which contests elections in other States, including in Punjab in 2022, on Mr. Kejriwal’s face value and the ‘Delhi Model’ of governance, it will be hard to recover from the combination of both the losses.\\n\\nParty insiders say the shift in middle class voters to the BJP cost them the election. But many workers say the distance between the leaders and the workers has also grown as the party grew. With just 22 out of 70 seats in Delhi now, it is the worst performance of the AAP since it was formed. Another question is that will the AAP, which has almost never been without power in Delhi, survive five years or more without power?\\n\\nUnlike the Left or the BJP, where people rise through the ranks over years if not decades to become MLAs or Ministers, many of the AAP leaders had reached those positions almost overnight without cutting their teeth in politics for years. That said, the AAP’s vote share in the Delhi election was only 2 percentage point less than that of the BJP. In contrast, the Congress is behind the saffron party by almost 39 percentage points.\\n\\nAlso, a change in law by the Union government in May 2023, which negated a Supreme Court judgment, and gave the control of the bureaucracy in the Delhi government to the Union government-appointed Lieutenant-Governor. This is a crucial factor in Delhi, which is not a full State. Many AAP supporters believe that the party’s fortunes could have been different if Delhi was a full State. It would be mistake to write off the AAP as it has time and again demonstrated the ability to bounce back from setbacks.\\n\\nBut what is to be seen is whether the party, having moved away from many of its core ideas, will be able to stand out from other parties or whether the public will see it as just another political party.', 'Two days after winning the Delhi Assembly election, the BJP on Monday said its Chief Minister will not occupy “Sheesh Mahal”, referring to the 6, Flagstaff Road bungalow where Arvind Kejriwal stayed as the Chief Minister from 2015 till he stepped down in October 2024.\\n\\nThe property is under scrutiny by Central probe agencies for “irregularities” in its renovation.\\n\\nDelhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva made the announcement shortly after he wrote to Lieutenant-Governor V.K. Saxena requesting the demerger of the four government properties, which he claimed were amalgamated during the bungalow’s revamp.\\n\\nHe said eight Type-V flats and two government bungalows were amalgamated with the Flagstaff Road bungalow in Civil Lines to create “a lavish complex spanning over 50,000 square metres”.\\n\\nThe Delhi BJP president sought the L-G’s “urgent intervention to restore these properties to their original status and return 6, Flagstaff Road to its previous area of less than 10,000 square metres”.\\n\\nThe State BJP president said that the call regarding the future of the bungalow will be taken soon after the party assumes power.\\n\\nIn the run-up to the Delhi poll, the BJP repeatedly attacked Mr. Kejriwal, the Aam Aadmi Party chief, for building a “₹45-crore Sheesh Mahal” for himself.', 'Delhi Metro will start its operation on all lines from their terminal stations at 4 a.m. on voting and counting day in order to facilitate the staff deployed for election duty, a statement said on Monday (February 3, 2025).\\n\\nThe trains will run with a frequency of 30 minutes on all the lines till 6 a.m. After 6 a.m., regular metro train services will run throughout the day, it said.\\n\\nThe Delhi Police has also made elaborate traffic arrangements aiming to ease the voting experience for the general public and voters.\\n\\n\"On the day of the Assembly election in Delhi on February 5 and the vote counting day on February 8, Delhi Metro train services on all lines will start from their terminal stations at 4 a.m. so that the staff deployed for election duty can avail the facility,\" the DMRC statement said.\\n\\nIn addition, to facilitate the polling officials/staff returning late after election duty, the last metro services on all lines will be also extended on the intervening night of February 5 and 6, it said.\\n\\nThe time has been extended from 11 p.m. to 12 p.m. on the Red Line.

This change should happen in our democratic system.”\\n\\n“Let a Brahmin or Naidu look after affairs of tribals, there will be a big change. I have made this request to Modi ji, but there are certain customs for these things,” he said.\\n\\nMr. Gopi also said that since he became a Rajya\\xa0Sabha MP in\\xa02016, he has been requesting Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he doesn’t want the civil aviation portfolio and to give him the tribal affairs portfolio instead.\\n\\nAfter his comments kicked up a controversy, Mr. Gopi clarified on Sunday, “I had said that an upper caste person should come to look after the affairs of tribals and a person from a backward community should look after the problems of the upper caste...

As it did in other poll-bound states, BJP has offered ‘free power’ to the poor via its solar energy scheme, the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana. On the subject of water, BJP has promised to implement its Jal Jeevan Mission\\n\\nFarmers and pollution\\n\\n100% registration of all farmers under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana with ₹9000 annual assistance and setting up of Atal Canteens offering meals at ₹5 are BJP’s poll promises related to agriculture. Tackling the polluted air and Yamuna waters, the BJP has promised to increase Delhi’s water treatment capacity to 1500 MCD, a flood-free Delhi with ₹700 crore investment, and to revitalise Yamuna with 100% effluent-treatment and zero industrial emissions into the river. For clean air, it has promised to halve Delhi’s average air quality index (AQI), reduce PM-2.5 and PM-10 levels by 50%, transition 50% vehicles to electric/hybrid and make Delhi a 100% e-bus city.\\n\\nOther groups\\n\\nSenior citizens between ages 60-70 have been promised a monthly pension of ₹2500 by the BJP while those above 70 years will get ₹3000 per month. While AAP was the first to offer an honarium of ₹18,000 per month to Hindu priests and Gurudwara\\xa0granthis, BJP subsequently surpassed it\\xa0promising ₹20,000 to them.\\xa0 The saffron party has also promised a ₹3000 monthly pension to small traders, welfare boards for auto, taxi drivers, washermen, gig economy workers and domestic workers and a mechanised dhobi ghat.\\n\\nHousing and infrastructure\\n\\nBJP has promised to grant full ownership rights to 1700 unauthorised colonies and freehold property status to all refugees’ colonies and promised to investigate scams that took place during AAP’s regime. Aided by the Centre, BJP has promised to attract $50 billion in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Delhi, to effect a complete infrastructure overhaul and to make Chandni Chowk Delhi’s first model marketplace.\\n\\nDelhi voted on February 5 and witnessed a voter turnout of 60.54%. Over 94.5 lakh citizens cast their votes in the high-stakes AAP Vs BJP fight.', 'The Delhi Assembly election saw a division of Muslim votes but despite that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) managed to win six out of the seven seats which have a substantial population of the community.\\n\\nA total of four Muslim candidates made it to the Delhi Assembly, down from five last time.\\n\\nThe four winning Muslim candidates are Imran Hussain from Ballimaran, Aaley Mohammed Iqbal from Matia Mahal, Amanatullah Khan from Okhla and Chaudhary Zubair Ahmad from Seelampur. All four contested on an AAP ticket.\\n\\nIn 2020, the AAP won all the seven seats with a substantial Muslim population - Okhla, Babarpur, Mustafabad, Seelampur, Matia Mahal, Ballimaran and Chandni Chowk. This time it won six barring Mustafabad which saw a three-way split of the Muslim vote between the AAP, All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), and the Congress.\\n\\nWhile in 2020, the Muslims had by and large voted for the AAP, there was a split in the community\\'s vote this time but not enough to dent the party\\'s chances in Muslim-dominated areas.\\n\\nThe only exception was Mustafabad where a split in votes among the three Muslim candidates of AAP, AIMIM, and the Congress paved the way for a big win of the Bharatiya Janata Party\\'s Mohan Singh Bisht from Mustafabad by 17,578 votes.\\n\\nThe Muslim candidates together polled 1,12,874 votes in Mustafabad. The AIMIM candidate Tahir Hussain, jailed in connection with the 2020 Delhi riots, secured 33,474 votes to finish third.\\n\\nHowever, in other seats where Muslims have a substantial vote - Okhla, Babarpur, Seelampur, Matia Mahal, Ballimaran and Chandni Chowk - AAP candidates won by handsome margins. In Okhla, AIMIM candidate Shifa-ur-Rehman got 39,558 votes, finishing third.\\n\\nThere were broadly three strands of thinking in the city\\'s Muslim-dominated areas.\\n\\nOne, that the BJP has to be stopped at all cost and for that it is important to vote for the AAP because only the Arvind Kejriwal-led party can stop the saffron juggernaut in Delhi.\\n\\nTwo, the view gaining traction among many Muslims was that the AAP deserted them during the 2020 riots and played a dubious role in \"blaming\" the Tablighi Jamaat for the COVID-19 spread. Therefore, the community should go with the Congress with Rahul Gandhi \"raising the issues of the deprived and being the voice of secularism\".\\n\\nThe third was that some believed there was no point in backing either the AAP or the Congress and it is better to go with Asaduddin Owaisi\\'s AIMIM as it at least raises community specific-issues and problems. This view gained more currency with the AIMIM fielding jailed members of the community booked in the 2020 riots or involved in the CAA-NRC protest as their candidates.\\n\\nHowever, in the end, the first view of voting for the party that stops the BJP seems to have had its dominant say in Muslim dominated areas with AAP managing to win by comfortable margins.\\n\\nThe BJP cleaned out the AAP in Delhi and returned to power in the city after more than 26 years, extending its saffron imprint and dealing a devastating blow to the Arvind Kejriwal-led party whose top leadership crumbled or barely made it.', 'The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made a triumphant return to power in Delhi after 27 years, securing a commanding majority with 48 seats in the Assembly elections. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) now takes on the role of the main opposition with 22 seats, while the Congress suffered a complete wipeout, failing to win a single seat.\\n\\nThis election saw a major shake-up, with key AAP leaders—including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Saurabh Bhardwaj, and Somnath Bharti—losing their seats by narrow margins. However, Atishi managed to hold on, defeating BJP’s Ramesh Bidhuri in Kalkaji.\\n\\nSeveral leaders who switched parties ahead of the elections found success. Kailash Gahlot, a former AAP minister who joined the BJP, secured a win from Bijwasan. Zubair Ahmed, who moved from Congress to AAP, emerged victorious in Seelam Pur, while Arvinder Singh Lovely, another Congress defector, won from Gandhi Nagar. However, former AAP minister Raj Kumar Anand, who defected to the BJP, lost in Patel Nagar.\\n\\nThe BJP secured 45.56% of the vote share, while AAP closely trailed with 43.57%. Several BJP heavyweights, including Parvesh Verma, Mohan Singh Bisht, Tarvinder Singh Marwah, Kapil Mishra, and Satish Upadhyay, won their seats comfortably. However, BJP’s Ramesh Bidhuri faced a tough defeat in Kalkaji.\\n\\nWith this landslide victory, the BJP has successfully reclaimed Delhi, setting the stage for a new political chapter in the capital. All eyes are now on the party’s leadership as it prepares to name Delhi’s next Chief Minister.', 'Chief Minister Atishi has won from the Kalkaji seat defeating BJP rival Ramesh Bidhuri by 3,521 votes at the end of the twelfth rounds of counting for the Delhi Assembly polls , the Election Commission website showed.\\n\\nMs. Atishi got 52,154 votes, with Mr. Bidhuri losing with 48,633 votes.

I have been MLA three times and MP two times, positions do not matter to us.\"\\n\\nEarly counting trends showed the BJP leading in 41 seats, while the AAP was ahead in 29. The Delhi Assembly has 70 seats.', 'Story so far: “50 seats will ensure a comfortable government for BJP,” said BJP candidate from Kalkaji, Ramesh Bidhuri , on Saturday (February 8, 2025) as the saffron party took an early lead of 40+ seats in the Delhi Assembly elections . As per Election Commission of India (ECI), BJP is currently leading in 46 seats, followed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 24 seats.

Tyagi, Anil Jha. Congress leaders who joined AAP are Veer Singh Dhingan, Sumesh Shokeen, Zubair Ahmed, while Arvinder Singh Lovely and Rajkumar Chauhan joined BJP.\\n\\nBJP\\n\\nOne of its biggest steals from Congress — State president Arvinder Singh Lovely — is leading from Gandhi Nagar by 7,267 votes, against AAP’s Naveen Chaudhary.

AAP had fielded ex-Congress MLA Devender Sehrawat against him.\\n\\nIn Patel Nagar, former AAP Minister Raaj Kumar Anand, who also joined BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha polls is trailing AAP’s Pravesh Ratan by 4,521 votes. Mr. Anand, who had served in the Kejriwal cabinet from 2022, faced Mr. Ratan, who himself switched from the BJP to AAP.\\n\\nSitting two-time MLA Kartar Singh Tanwar is set to retain Chhatarpur as he leads by 3,974 votes against AAP’s Bramh Singh Tanwar. The two-time MLA jumped ship from AAP to BJP ahead of the state polls, while ex-MLA Bramh Singh Tanwar switched to AAP after the saffron party denied him a ticket from his old constituency.\\xa0In Kasturba Nagar, ex-Congress MLA Neeraj Basoya, who has been fielded by the BJP is leading by 10,781 votes.\\n\\nAAP\\n\\nEx-BJP leader Jitender Singh Shunty who is AAP’s Shahdara candidate is trailing behind BJP’s Sanjay Goyal by 8,658 votes.

Over 94.5 lakh citizens cast their votes in the high-stakes AAP Vs BJP fight.', 'Addressing a rally in north-east Delhi’s Mustafabad on Saturday, Union Minister Amit Shah hailed the Union Budget, saying it has brought smiles to the Purvanchali community and the middle class.\\n\\n“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made Purvanchalis happy through this Budget. Modi ji has provided schemes worth crores for Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. He has freed the middle class from paying tax if they earn up to ₹12 lakh annually,” he said.\\n\\nPurvanchalis, a term for residents of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and those who hail from there in the Capital, comprise one of the largest voter bases in the city. They are expected to play an important role in the February 5 Delhi Assembly election.\\n\\nAddressing hundreds of party supporters, Mr. Shah said, “All gig workers will now register on the e-Shram portal. You will get free treatment. Modi ji has made such an arrangement.” He was referring to the social security scheme for gig workers announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech.\\n\\nMr. Shah was among the several national BJP leaders who held rallies in the city to boost the campaign of the BJP, which is looking to return to power in Delhi after 27 years. Other senior leaders who held rallies included party president J.P. Nadda, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, and Chief Ministers of U.P., Haryana, and Assam.\\n\\nMr. Modi is also set to address his fifth and final rally in the city on Sunday.\\n\\nAccusing the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of engaging in corruption and sheltering illegal immigrants, the Home Minister said there is a “big wave” against AAP. He accused the party of running a “3G” government — “ ghaphla , ghuspaithiyon ko panah , aur ghotala (corruption, sheltering illegal immigrants, scams)”.\\n\\nThe BJP leader also appealed to voters to ensure that “those responsible for the riots [in north-east Delhi in February 2020] are not elected again”.', 'The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has managed to hit the right chord with Delhi’s Purvanchali voters in the State’s Assembly election , winning 70% of the seats dominated by these migrants from eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand as it returns to power in the capital after almost three decades.\\n\\nPurvanchalis, who generally vote as a bloc, are estimated to account for nearly a third of Delhi’s electorate. Out of the capital’s 70 Assembly seats, 51 have significant Purvanchali populations. In fact, in 27 of these seats, the majority of voters are from Purvanchal. With political parties giving increasing attention to Purvanchali voters, Delhi got 10 lawmakers from the community in 2020 in comparison to just two in 1993.\\n\\nThe BJP promised to clean up the Yamuna and ensure the grand celebration of Chhath, one of the biggest festivals for the people of Purvanchal, involving a procession to the riverbank. The winning party also vowed to develop the riverfront as was done for the Sabarmati in Ahmedabad, and also build homes for migrants under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, a flagship housing scheme. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) banked on its freebies to woo the community, while the Congress promised to set up a full-fledged Purvanchal Ministry with a special provision in the State Budget for their welfare.\\n\\nIn the Assembly election, the BJP fielded four Purvanchali candidates, while its campaign in Purvanchali areas was fronted by Bhojpuri stars like Ravi Kishan, Dinesh Lal Yadav Nirahua, and Manoj Tiwari, as well as senior party leaders from the area including U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The party also gave a seat each to two of its allies in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which have their bases in Bihar, the Janata Dal (United) and the Lok Janshakti Party (Ramvilas), though both of their candidates lost.\\n\\nAll four of the BJP’s Purvanchali faces won their races. In Sangam Vihar, where over half of the electorate is Purvanchali, the BJP’s Chandan Choudhary defeated three-time AAP MLA Dinesh Mohaniya. The BJP also won the Vikaspuri Assembly seat with Pankaj Kumar Singh defeating three-time AAP MLA Mahinder Yadav. In Dwarka, Parduymn Rajput managed to make a comeback as an MLA for the first time since 2013, defeating the AAP’s Vinay Mishra. In Karawal Nagar, Kapil Mishra won for the second time after 2015, but on a BJP ticket. He was earlier an AAP MLA.\\n\\nOther BJP candidates also found success in Purvanchali-dominated constituencies. In Palam, the\\xa0BJP’s Kuldeep Solanki secured victory against the AAP’s Joginder Solanki, while in Lakshmi Nagar, the BJP’s Abhay Verma won against the AAP’s B.B. Tyagi. In Matiala, the BJP’s Sandeep Sehrawat managed to defeat the AAP’s Sumesh Shokeen.\\n\\nIn Rithala, the BJP’s Kulwant Rana, who had represented the seat in 2008 and 2013, defeated the AAP’s Mohinder Goel. In Mangolpuri, Raj Kumar Chauhan, a four-time Congress MLA who contested on a BJP ticket this year, defeated the AAP’s Dharam Rakshak alias Rakesh Jatav. The saffron party also swept the Badli seat, with Ahir Deepak Chaudharyy defeating the AAP’s Ajesh Yadav.\\n\\nThe AAP fielded 12 Purvanchalis faces, while its senior Purvanchali leaders like Sanjay Singh also campaigned for candidates across Delhi.\\n\\nThe AAP managed to win Burari and Babarpur, two Purvanchali-dominated constituencies, with Sanjay Jha and Gopal Rai securing their seats despite the strong saffron wave in the capital. The party also managed to retain Deoli, with Prem Chauhan defeating the LJP’s Deepak Tanwar, while the AAP’s Anil Jha managed to win the Kiradi seat. In Seemapuri, Veer Singh Dhingan won on an AAP ticket; he had previously won this seat in 1998, 2003, and 2008 as a Congress candidate.\\n\\nThe Congress fielded four Purvanchali faces, but failed to win a single seat in the Assembly election.']\n"
